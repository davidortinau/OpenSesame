# Holiday 2017 Experiment 
I broke our 20+ year old garage door opener...pieces flew everwhere in a glorious demise. The new "garage bot" is wifi enabled, so of course I must tinker. It's nothing mind-blowing, but it has been a good excuse to spend some time using a variety of things I've been wanting to explore:

- [Flurl HTTP Client](https://github.com/tmenier/Flurl)
- [SkiaSharp SVG](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp)
- Reactive Extensions and [ReactiveUI](https://reactiveui.net/)
- [Xamarin.Forms CSS Stylesheets](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/pull/1207)
- Azure Cognitive Services and Bing Speech Recognition
